# BI-Dashboard-Analysis-MVP-system
This project is a MVP design of a future expandable version fully autonomous business decision making analysis tool.

Currently this is the project flow 

1. User uploads dashboard
     
2. OCR extracts text/values
     
3. Parser structures data into dict
     
4. Company metadata + dashboard â†’ heuristic rules
     
5. Structured input sent to LLM with system prompt
   
6. LLM outputs business recommendations
     


Later on the tool can be adapted into a full chatbot with RAG and memory to assist on how to achieve business solutions


Later make the tool able to process business documents as input to the tool so it can automatically figure out important info in formulating business solutions

and provide even more insightful and impactful business decisions
